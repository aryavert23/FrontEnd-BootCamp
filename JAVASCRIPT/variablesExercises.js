// 1) Create a boolean variable called "myBoolean" and set it to true
const myBoolean = true;

// 2) Create a string variable called "myString" and set it to "hello world"
const myString = "hello world";

// 3) Create a number variable called "firstNumber" and set it equal to '20'
const firstNumber = 20;

// 4) Create another number variable called "secondNumber" and set it to equal to '40'
let secondNumber = 40;

// 5) Re-assign "secondNumber" and set it equal to '80'
secondNumber = 80;

// 6) Create an array called "myArray" and put "myBoolean" at index 0 and "myString" at index 1
const myArray = [myBoolean, myString];

// 7) Creat an object called "myObject" and assign "myArray" to a property called "firstProperty" and the 
// sum of 'firstNumber' and 'secondNumber' to a property called "sumProperty"
const myObject = {firstProperty: myArray, sumProperty: firstNumber + secondNumber};

// 8) Print "myObject" to the console
console.log(myObject);

// 9) Print the "sumProperty" of "myObject" to the console
console.log(myObject.sumProperty);

// 10) Print the value at index 1 of "firstProperty"
console.log(myObject.firstProperty[1]);
